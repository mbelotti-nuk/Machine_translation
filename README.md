# Machine_translation
 I created this repository to independently develop 2 types of models used for translation: Sequence to Sequence and Transformers.

 In the `architecture` folder are found my implementation of these two models in Pytorch. In the `tokenization` folder, a class used to handle tokenization with HugginFace's *WordPiece* is available. <br>
 These are trained for the translation from italian to french in the two jupyter notebooks at the root of the repository.
